We need to define data literacy before developing a measure that has construct validity. For instance, the initial step towards training the general population to be data literate might revolve around awareness about the data being generated and collected everyday, understanding what data science can or cannot do, and a basic idea about how data science can impact their respective fields. Moving forwards, and even more ideally, some people may define data literacy as the ability to apply data science-- understanding and using the theories and tools to collect, analyze, generate conclusions, and make predictions from the data-- and having expertise in computer science, statistics, and a specific domain. I would design some tests to measure data literacy, but of course, the specific items and how the test is administered will be contingent on how data literacy is defined.

My name is Ke (pronounced as ""Kuh""), and I am a program evaluation professional in the field of K-12 education. I have received training in causal inferences in the social sciences field, but am very interested in using this course to enhance and expand my knowledge.

To measure the success of an online course, I would look for certain indicators, and these will include:  
1. The number of students enrolled in the course   
2. The number and percentage of students who complete the course with a passing grade (as a measure of student ""retention"")  
3. Student knowledge gains regarding the learning objectives of the course (assessed through pre- and post-survey)  
4. The extent to which students are satisfied with the clarity of instruction, relevance of course materials and assessment, etc. (assessed through a survey)  
5. How likely are the students going to incorporate the knowledge into their learning, job, or research (assessed through the survey)  
6. Student satisfaction with the course, as compared with other online courses that they have taken (if any) and traditional, face-to-face courses (again, assessed through the survey)

That's all for now. I look forward to learning new ideas.

My name is Brandon Evans, I am taking the course because I am interested in the subject and learning more about predictive modeling.  I am excited to learn more throughout this course and will likely take the other two in this series. 

A little about myself, I am really curious person that loves to travel and loves to share with friends and family. I wish I had more time for both, but always excited to take advantage of an opportunity to do either!!!

I imagine that tracking success should be based on two pillars, lets call them satisfaction and achievement. Satisfaction would be a survey with standard Likert scales given to the students. Surveys with related questions should be proctored before and after the course to get a better overall feel if objectives were fulfilled.

The achievement pillar should measure attendance, scores and their distribution, how the scores and attendance compare to past classes. I think also some kind of Likert scale survey that the professor fills out, not just the grades, would also be important.

The success of any course, can be measured according to a framework similar to the Kirkpatrick Model for evaluating training effectiveness - an online course can be modified slightly to arrive at something similar to the following:

Level 1: Participation
Level 2: Completion
Level 3: Satisfaction
Level 4: Learning Retention
Level 5: Application of Learning
Level 6: Effectiveness of Application 
Level 7: Return on Investment of Learning

   I agree with you, to a point. A successful course may not always be interesting; it certainly may be required. Picture something in you field of study that, to put it blunt, sucks! But it is necessary to learn. This subject matter is not, not successful because it lacks interest and may not be interactive. 

   Maybe, think no further than say Math- how interactive can that be? I do agree, though, that success depends on the individual, thus, the interactive nature of the course will vary from person-to-person.
